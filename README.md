## General Projects and Examples

- Designing a mini e-commerce application
- Creating a class structure for a custom blog platform
- Designing classes for simulating genetic algorithms

## Examples Related to Genes

To help understand OOP concepts, let's explore some examples related to genes:

### Gene Class

```python
class Gene:
    def __init__(self, name, sequence):
        self.name = name
        self.sequence = sequence

    def mutate(self, new_sequence):
        self.sequence = new_sequence

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}: {self.sequence}"

# Usage example
gene1 = Gene("Gene A", "ATGCGTA")
print(gene1)
gene1.mutate("ATGCTTA")
print(gene1)
